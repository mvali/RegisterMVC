    <a href="http://lookbetteronline.com/home/Page.asp?page=tips">How to prepare for your photo shoot</a><br />
    <br /> Your photographer will contact you soon (within just 2 business days) to confirm your appointment. At that time they will let you know if the date requested is available, or if they have to reschedule with you for another time and date. Nothing is set in stone until you have spoken with the photographer. At the time of contact, they will speak to you about your photo package, wardrobe choices, location of shoot and any other remaining details with you regarding your photo session.<br /> <br /> After the photo shoot, your photographer will ask you to choose your favorite photos.&nbsp;
    Remember these are web ready images (1200x1800 pixels) suitable for your online dating sites. He/She will then upload them to the LookBetterOnline support team (within 2 business days), and we will check them to ensure they meet the highest quality, then you will be notified by email that your photos are ready. You will then simply login to collect your new photos. We hope that you love them!&nbsp; Please remember to let your photographer know how pleased you are by leaving a testimonial and rate your photo session. This will be very easy to do before you download your images.<br />
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word;">
    <strong>Cancellations </strong><br />If you cancel within 24 hours of your shoot, you are still obligated to
    pay for that shoot as LookBetterOnline is responsible to pay the
    photographer for scheduling you that day. When rescheduling your new
    shoot with the photographer, we will offer you a discounted rate for the
    same package but ask that you then pay your photographer directly on
    the day of your new shoot.<br />&nbsp;
    <br />Discounted rates apply only when you are rescheduling a photo shoot after you cancelled your first within 24 hours of originally scheduled shoot.  Rates are as follows:&nbsp; Silver package - $85, Gold package - $95, Platinum package - $115.
